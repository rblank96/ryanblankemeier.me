              I am a Dartmouth 20 from Oak Park IL, on the outskirts of Chicago. My passions as a kid were sports and music, as I played hockey, baseball, soccer, and piano. Mid-way through high school, hockey began to take the majority of my time, and I dropped my other sports and regular music lessons to focus full time on hockey and school. I took a gap year to play in the United States Hockey League for the Green Bay Gamblers. I discovered my interest for computer science while taking CS1 with Hany Farid my freshman fall. Being at Dartmouth has been the best of both worlds for me as I have been able to play my sport at the division one level while also pursuing my academic interests and computer science.
