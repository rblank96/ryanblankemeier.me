            <p class="lead" style="text-align:text-left; padding-left:20px; padding-bottom:20px">At Dartmouth I have taken CS1, CS10, CS50, and CS30. I am proficient in Python, Java, C, Matlab, and Stata. I have some experience with HTML, SQL, CSS, Javascript, ReactJS, and ReactNative. Though I am confident with skills I have learned in a formal setting, I am also comfortable learning on the job as I did last summer at REX Real Estate. I spent most of my time there working with AI platforms to create a facebook chatbot, and a robot that could show a home. The facebook chatbot was released on their facebook website to redirect questions coming in from buyers, seller, and agents. The showing robot was used in an open house that I conducted (I was chosen to accompany the robot because my lack of understanding of the real estate process would display if the robot actually answered peoples questions) and the house sold within a week. The robot ended up being featured in an article in the New York Post. Along with the technical and real world skills I picked up at my internship, through my athletics I have gained confidence in being a productive member of a team. I have been in many positions, whether leadership roles or non-leadership roles, and I enjoy working with people toward a common goal. I feel DALI would be a good experience for me by combining my interests of teamwork and computer science.</p>
