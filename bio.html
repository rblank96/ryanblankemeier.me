During the fall and winter, hockey takes most of my time with lifts, on-ice practices, and games each week. Outside of hockey I am involved in the DOC as I love the outdoors. I love to hike with friends and go on kayaking trips down the river. I am also a member of the Alpha Chi Alpha fraternity which has given me another community of people outside hockey. I fill my remaining extra time with hobbies such as woodworking at the woodshop, playing guitar and piano, and reading.</p>
